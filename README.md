## Projects :mortar_board: 

### S-wear-store

A clothing store for women, men, kids and plus size ðŸ‘š. This project is my last project that I wrote. In this project I implemented a lot of things that I learned in the course. In this project I used 'React' and 'Redux' to the client side and 'TypeScript' to the server side and SQL for the Data-base.

### Pokedex

This project I wrote with a team member during the course. This was a learning project that we learned a lot from this project. We learned both kinds of Data-base , Sql and MongoDB , we learned also how to write the server side and the most important we learned how to work with someone else.

### Checkers-game

This project is my 'Course Admission Project'. I wrote this project for 3 days after a month of learning.

### Chess-game

This is my first project that I wrote. During the course we wrote some project, this one is the first one that I wrote and during this project I started to learned how to proggram and how much I like to do it.
