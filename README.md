## Projects :mortar_board: 

### S-wear-store

A clothing store for women, men, kids and plus size ðŸ‘š. This project is the last project that I wrote. In this project I implemented a lot of things that I learned in the course and used 'React' and 'Redux' to the client side, 'TypeScript' to the server side and SQL for the Data-base.

### Pokedex

I wrote this project with a team member during the course. We learned two kinds of Data-bases, SQL and MongoDB, we also learned how to write the server side and the most importantly, how to cooperate with someone else.

### Checkers-game

This project is my 'Course Admission Project'. I wrote this project for 3 days after a month of learning.

### Chess-game

During the course we wrote some projects, this one is the first one that I wrote and during this project I started to learn how to program and how much I enjoy it.
